## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a reference to the method used in the package. But I haven't been online yet, so I added the url.
The dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (see <http://lib.pusan.ac.kr/resource/e-article/?app=eds&mod=detail&record_id=edsker.000004649097&db_id=edsker> for more information)

* Removed the phrase "This package" from the comment field.

I would be appreciated if you check my resubmission.
Thank you for your consideration!
