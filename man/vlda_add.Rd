\usage{
vlda_add(fit, add.col = NULL, add.row = NULL, time.name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object returned by vlda()}

\item{add.col}{A data matirx, The type of indicator matrix. Additional data sets in column format. \eqn{p \ge 2}}

\item{add.row}{A data matirx, The type of indicator matrix. Additional data sets in row format.
Supplemental data should have the same variable name as \code{fit$ind.mat} returned by \code{\link{vlda}},
and if it is not an indicator matrix, you can use it after generate an indicator matrix using \code{\link{indicator}} built into vlda.}

\item{time.name}{If supplemental data to add contains a time variable, it requires argument a character string that specifies the name of the time variable.}
}
\value{
\item{...}{Same as the result of vlda}
\item{sup.coordiante}{A tibble data class, coordinates of new objects created when adding supplementary data in the vlda plot already provided.}
}
\description{
Add objects or variables with new information to the two-dimensional VLDA plot proposed for multidimensional longitudinal data.
}
\details{
The longitudinal data inevitably has the characteristic that supplementary data is added as follows: \cr

● Outcome variables measured at additional time points, such as \eqn{T+1, T+2, ...} after the last time point \eqn{T}. \cr
● New objects that are not previously measured.\cr
● Other covariates that indicate the characteristics of objects.\cr

Find coordinates representing objects and variables that are added in the VLDA plot already
provided, through a method obtain that find coordinates on low-dimensional space for supplementary elements.
